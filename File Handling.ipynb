    "# Python is versatile and can handle many types of files, the most fundamental ones are text and binary files\n",
    "Text files are files that contain plain text and can be read and written with the open function, which has modes like 'r' for reading and 'w' for writing. Example file extensions:.txt,.csv, and.json.\n",
    "Binary files contain binary data and can be read and written using the open function, but in different modes, such as 'rb' for reading binary and 'wb' for writing binary. For example: Images (.jpg,.png) and audio files (.mp3,.wav).).\n",
    "\n",
    "# File vs File Object\n",
    "\n",
    "# File\n",
    "\n",
    "A file is a document or a piece of information that can be created, modified and stored by a user or an operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a file can be either text or binary. In this course, we will only work with text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast_Cancer.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "# File Object\n",
    "\n",
    "A file object is a python object that holds data imported from a file. To use a file in our program, we first need to import it and convert it into a file object. Once it is a file object, we can modify it as needed. This object contains methods and properties for dealing with the file, including reading from, writing to, and closing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "file_path = 'C:/Users/user/Desktop/Breast_Cancer.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading and Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is the process of obtaining and retrieving the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing often entails analysing the structure of the file's content and extracting important data into an organised format, such as lists, dictionaries, or data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a file entails examining its contents. Think of it as opening a book and reading the words on the pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing is the process of making sense of information read from a file. It's similar to discovering the chapters and parts of a book and comprehending its structur\n",
    "\n",
    "When you parse a file, you understand its contents to extract the most significant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Structures\n",
    "    \n",
    "Data structures are methods of organising and storing data to be easily accessed and used. They determine the efficiency with which data is processed and stored. Data structures may increase speed, minimise resource use, and make code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data refers to information that is organized in a way that makes finding specific pieces of information easy. This type of data is often in a tabular form, such as an Excel spreadsheet or SQL database. It can also be stored in databases and managed from one computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured data refers to information that is not organized in a way that makes finding specific pieces of information easy. This type of data can include video, audio, photos, presentations, web pages, text, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semi-Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-structured data refers to a middle ground between structured and unstructured data. Semi-structured data does not have a rigid structure like structured data, but it still has some organizational properties, such as tags or markers to separate data elements. This type of data is more about using different patterns for storing and organizing the data in a way that makes it easier to access and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation),\n",
